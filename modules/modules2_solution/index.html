the morning, before students go to school and before adults go
to work. Many American children drink orange juice and eat
cereal with milk. Adults like to drink coffee or tea in the
morning. Another popular breakfast food is toast with butter or
jam. Other popular foods are oatmeal, fruit, yogurt, eggs,
bacon, sausages, French toast
, waffles
, and of course,
pancakes. Pancakes are a type of sweet bread cooked in a
pan on the stove. They are round and flat. Pancakes are
especially delicious with butter and maple syrup.</p></section>

the afternoon. Most students eat lunch at school, and either bring
their lunch from home or eat at the school cafeteria. Many
students bring sandwiches. Peanut butter and jelly sandwiches
are very common among children, but sandwiches with cheese,
sliced meat (such as turkey or ham), lettuce, mayonnaise
, and mustard, are also common. Most adults eat at work or go out to
a restaurant. Some adults bring leftovers to work for lunch – extra
food from dinner the night before.</p></section>

Because many people from around the world have immigrated to the
United States in the past 200 years, there is not really one type of
American food. Many types of food from all around the world are popular in
the United States, such as Chinese food, Italian food, Japanese food, and
Mexican food. All of these foods are an important part of the American diet.
When the weather is warm, Americans like to grill hamburgers, hot
dogs, and other types of meat for a barbecue. Soups and stews
are also
popular in the winter.</p></section>
